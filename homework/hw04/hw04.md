# Problem 3 (20 pts)

For All the methods you defined in Problems 1 and 2 of homework 3, write tests to test if they do what you expect them to do. For example, to test the `__lt__` method defined in Point class, we can do the following.

```python
import unittest
class TestMyCode(unittest.TestCase):
    def testComparatorlt(self):
        point1 = Point(3, 4)
        point2 = Point(1, 2)
        self.assertEqual(point1<point2, False)
```

## Requirements

- Define you own test inside the above class to test other methods you have written in Problems 1 and 2 of homework 3.
- Create one test for each method.
- Hint: you need to import or include the classes you defined in your homework 3.
