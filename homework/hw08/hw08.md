# Problem 1 (40 pts)

A professor measured the time (in seconds) required to catch a falling yard stick for 12 randomly selected students' dominant hand and nondominant hand. The professor claims that the reaction time in an individual's dominant hand is less than the reaction time in their nondominant hand. Test the claim at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level of significance.

Use the above data to answer the following questions.

## Part 1 - 10 pts

What is the null and alternative hypothesis?

## Part 2 - 10 pts

What is the correct test to perform? Is the underlying assumption satisfied? If not, check the assumptions.

1. **Paired t test**, since two population are dependent.

2. With a small sample size of 12, it is necessary to check the normality assumption (on d).

## Part 3 - 20 pts

Conduct the test to test the claim.
